# Stratego 2442

Stratego 2<b>442</b>

<b>Project Description:</b> Stratego 2442 is a Stratego clone game with a smaller board and faster playstyle. Unlike the full 40v40 battles, each team will have 25-30 units. Stratego 2442 will feature multiplayer support along with AI. As the name implies, the theme will be set in the future with unique units.

<b>Minimal Viable Product: </b> The minimum features of this game will include a fully playable Stratego clone that can be played via player-vs-player or through AI.<br>

<b>Add-on Features:</b><br>
1. Both AI AND PvP (very likely)<br>
2. Different levels of AI through a memory system (remembering last pieces)<br>
3. Ranking system<br>
4. Profile customization<br><br>

<b>User Story:</b> "I want to play a version of Stratego thats faster paced and has a unique theme".<br>
