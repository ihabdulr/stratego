<b>Project Description:</b> Stratego 2442 is a Stratego clone game with a smaller board and faster playstyle. Unlike the full 40v40 battles, each team will have 24 units. Stratego 2442 will feature multiplayer support along with AI. As the name implies, the theme will be set in the future with unique units.

<b>Minimal Viable Product: </b> The minimum features of this game will include a fully playable Stratego clone that can be played via player-vs-player or through AI.<br>

<b>Add-on Features:</b><br>
1. Both AI AND PvP (very likely)<br>
2. Different levels of AI through a memory system (remembering last pieces)<br>
3. Ranking system<br>
4. Profile customization<br><br>

<b>User Story:</b> "I want to play a version of Stratego thats faster paced and has a unique theme".<br>
