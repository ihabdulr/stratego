Meeting date: 07 Mar 18
Meeting time: 1400-1500

Attendance:
Alek, Aaron, Jeremiah (all present)

Meeting summary:
Discussed UI setup and creating the multiplayer game session

Accomplished since last meeting:
Created the game board, pieces, image loading and display, and much of the basic game setup.

Accomplish before next meeting:
Finish the initial menu and start work on the "searching for game" screen on the menu. Create the game session 
and the game state, whose turn it is. Client does not need to actually enter the game, but the framework
for it needs to exist.

Individual issues:
Aaron - Game session containing both players, game state, and list of pieces for each player
Alek - Continue client setup, show possible moves when you select a game board piece
Jeremiah - Finish main menu functionality, start work or finish the searching for game menu
