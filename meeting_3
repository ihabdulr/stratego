Meeting summary:
Discussed new project and what we need to do to catch up to speed. 

Accomplished since last meeting:
Since this is a new project, we are starting from a clean slate. No information is available for this required block>

Accomplish before next meeting:
Initial commit for the development branch, this will be expedited so all members can work on their individual pieces.<br>
We will reuse the client/server communication and get a basic barebones client running, similar to what was necessary for
the prototype. Simple graphics using Graphics2D in Java and potentiall adding placer sprites. 

Individual issues:
Aaron - On the server create game session class along with player class.
Alek - Setup basic client ready for painting, create various game classes such as board and piece
Jeremiah - Create menu with 3 buttons, Play vs AI, Play vs Player, and Exit
